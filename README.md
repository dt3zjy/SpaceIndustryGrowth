# Exploring the Growth of the Space Industry

My name is Daniel Tohti and this is a little project I did for my STS final paper. The paper explored the growth of the space industry and the potential environmental impacts this growth may have. The following repository contains the Python notebook that I did all my analysis in, along with a folder with pictures. Enjoy!
